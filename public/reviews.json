    "body": "My baseline recommendation for anyone that wants a laptop is the M1 MacBook Air. At $999 retail (as low as $850 on sale), people really need to justify why they would need to spend more. PC gaming is one good reason; not too many others beyond that."

There was a $1299 model with a RTX 1660ti in 2020 for $1299, which I think is more comparable to the $1650 model from BestBuy."

The vendor software (and maybe BIOS/firmware, if that caused the mystery drain?) I only notice when it gets in the way. Microsoft Signature AMD Advantage laptop when?"
